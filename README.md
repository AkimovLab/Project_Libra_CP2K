# Project_Libra_CP2K
This is the project repository for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in the neglect-of-back-reaction approximation at the many-body level of theory. The systems considered for the dynamics are Cd33Se33 and Si75H64. The project uses an interface between Libra and the CP2K software packages.
