In the namd file, you may notice terms such as "mb" and "sd". Originally, these referred to many-body and Slater-determinant, respectively. However, here they refer to electron-only and hole-only respectively. We decided to keep the variable names "mb" and "sd" to avoid having to rename 10s of variables within the script.
